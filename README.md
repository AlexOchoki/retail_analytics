# Retail Analytics – BI tool
This project is an end-to-end Data Engineering & Business Intelligence solution built to mirror real work done in modern retail analytics teams.
It simulates an integrated online + offline retail environment, using a medallion architecture, advanced SQL/Python modeling, and Power BI dashboards for unified insights across sales, e-commerce, marketing, and inventory.
The goal:
To demonstrate the full skillset required for a BI Analyst in a digital/omnichannel retail environment — from raw ingestion all the way to forecasting, experimentation, and storytelling.
